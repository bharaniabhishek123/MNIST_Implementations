# MNIST using Numpy  
Example code to implement a simple neural network to classify grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 - 9) from the MNIST dataset. The dataset contains 60,000 training
images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits, 0 - 9. Each image is 28 x 28 pixels
in size, and is generally represented as a 
at vector of 784 numbers. It also includes labels
for each example, a number indicating the actual digit (0 - 9) handwritten in that image.
A sample of a few such images along with their labels are shown below.


Number of hidden units = 300 
Activation function = Sigmoid
